		(WWW or simply the Web) is an information system that enables content sharing over the Internet through
		user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists. It allows documents and other
		Web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
		(HTTP). The WEB was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to
		the public in 199HTML It was conceived as a "universal linked information system". Documents and other media
		content are made available to the network through Web servers and can be accessed by programs such as Web
		browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings
		called uniform resource locators (URLs).
